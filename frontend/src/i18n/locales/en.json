      "I am Gábor Tóth, the creator and owner of TG Art Tattoo. I have been in the industry since 2018, but I only opened my own tattoo studio in Zalaegerszeg in 2023.",
      "Initially, I tried to learn and practice while working, but over time it became unsustainable, and I started building my own business. Since then, I have been putting much more effort into always being better and improving continuously so that I can create quality tattoos for you every day. In the past few years, I have achieved several successes, but I never feel like I can stop; I am always looking for new goals and challenges.",
      "Over the years, I have tried myself in several styles, but it was late that it really started to become clear what my direction is. I mostly move in the sketch and fineline line, within which I especially like to create in horror, animal, and plant-themed patterns, but I also like to spread my wings in the world of realism.",
      "For me, my clients are the most important, and I want to provide them with the best, so I try to be up to par in several styles. I believe that every tattoo has meaning and a story, so I am indescribably grateful for every person who chooses me because without them, I wouldn't be where I am! For me, this whole thing is not just work but also passion!"
